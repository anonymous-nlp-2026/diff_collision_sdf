- numpy, scipy, matplotlib
- [openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) (base VLA training framework)
- MuJoCo >= 3.0
- robosuite >= 1.4
- LIBERO (task suite)
- SafeLIBERO (collision-annotated variant; see below)

Install core dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install transformers accelerate einops scipy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

**SafeLIBERO**: A collision-annotated extension of the LIBERO benchmark for evaluating manipulation safety. SafeLIBERO adds per-timestep collision detection (obstacle displacement tracking) across two task suites:
- `safelibero_spatial` — spatial reasoning tasks with environmental obstacles
- `safelibero_object` — object manipulation tasks with nearby obstacles

SafeLIBERO is built on top of LIBERO and uses the same demonstration datasets. The collision detection layer monitors obstacle body displacements in the MuJoCo simulator at each control step.

**SDF Ground Truth**: Per-scene `.npz` files containing precomputed signed distance fields:
- `query_points`: [N, 3] xyz coordinates in workspace frame
- `sdf_values`: [N] signed distance values (negative = inside obstacle)
- Generated using `pysdf` from scene mesh geometry

## Reproducing Experiments

### 1. Training

**LoRA-only baseline** (Table 1, "LoRA-only"):
```bash
python code/training/train_pi05_lora_baseline.py \
    --scene spatial_bowl --seed 0 --gpu 0
```

**ColliForce (SDF auxiliary)** (Table 1, "ColliForce"):
```bash
python code/training/train_a1_sdf_aux_pi05.py \
    --scene spatial_bowl --seed 0 --gpu 0 --lambda_sdf 0.1
```

Key hyperparameters:
- Learning rate: 2.5e-5 (Phase 2, LoRA unfrozen)
- LoRA rank: 32, alpha: 32 (action expert); 16, alpha: 16 (PaliGemma vision encoder)
- SDF loss weight (lambda_sdf): 0.1 (best), ablated over {0.005, 0.01, 0.1}
- Training steps: 30,000 (Phase 1: 3,000 warmup, Phase 2: 27,000)
- Batch size: 32

### 2. Evaluation

Evaluation requires a running policy server (via openpi's `serve_policy.py`):

```bash
# Start policy server
python -m openpi.serve_policy --checkpoint ./checkpoints/<run_name>

# Run SafeLIBERO evaluation
python code/eval/eval_pi05_safelibero.py \
    --suite safelibero_spatial \
    --safety_level II \
    --task_id 0 \
    --n_episodes 50
```

Metrics reported:
- **CAR** (Collision Avoidance Rate): fraction of episodes with zero obstacle displacement > threshold
- **dfCAR** (displacement-filtered CAR): CAR excluding frozen/collapsed episodes (EE displacement < 5mm)
- **TSR** (Task Success Rate): fraction of episodes reaching the goal

### 3. Figure Reproduction

All figure scripts are self-contained with embedded data (no external data files needed, except `threshold_sensitivity_v2.csv` which is included):

```bash
cd code/figures/
python fig1_teaser_v2.py        # -> Fig 1
python plot_fig2.py             # -> Fig 2
python plot_fig3_combined.py    # -> Fig 3
python plot_fig5_combined.py    # -> Fig 5
python plot_threshold_sensitivity.py  # -> Appendix threshold sensitivity
```

## Supplementary Videos

The `videos/` directory contains representative rollout recordings from SafeLIBERO evaluation:

| Video | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `failure_collision_wooden_cabinet.mp4` | **Action collapse**: the agent's end-effector freezes near the obstacle, producing near-zero displacement while reporting high CAR — a false positive under naive collision metrics |
| `success_avoidance_wooden_cabinet.mp4` | **Genuine avoidance**: on the same task, ColliForce successfully picks up the bowl while actively steering around the obstacle |
| `failure_collision_top_drawer.mp4` | **Collision failure**: the agent collides with the cabinet drawer during a challenging reaching task |

These videos illustrate the key distinction between *action collapse* (inflated CAR due to inaction) and *genuine collision avoidance* (high CAR with task completion), which motivates the displacement-filtered CAR (dfCAR) metric proposed in the paper.
